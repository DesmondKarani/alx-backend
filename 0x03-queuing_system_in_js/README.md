# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

## Description
This project focuses on implementing a queuing system in JavaScript using Redis and Kue. It covers various aspects of working with Redis, including basic operations, hash values, and asynchronous operations. The project also involves building a basic Express app that interacts with a Redis server and queue.

## Project Information
- **Back-end | JavaScript | ES6 | Redis | NodeJS | ExpressJS | Kue**
- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Duration:** Jul 29, 2024 6:00 AM - Aug 1, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Manual QA review required**

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- How to run a Redis server on your machine
- How to perform simple operations with the Redis client
- How to use a Redis client with Node JS for basic operations
- How to store hash values in Redis
- How to deal with async operations with Redis
- How to use Kue as a queue system
- How to build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server
- How to build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server and queue
