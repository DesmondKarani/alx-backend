# 0x00. Pagination

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing pagination techniques for datasets, particularly using Python. The aim is to understand and apply various pagination strategies, ensuring efficiency and resilience in handling large data sets. The project will cover simple page and page_size parameters, hypermedia metadata, and deletion-resilient pagination.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
1. Paginate a dataset using simple page and page_size parameters.
2. Paginate a dataset using hypermedia metadata.
3. Implement pagination in a manner that is resilient to deletions.

## Requirements
- All files must be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7).
- Each file should end with a new line.
- The first line of every file must be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should adhere to the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*).
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`.
- Modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- Functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Documentation should be a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.
- Functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Setup
Use the provided `Popular_Baby_Names.csv` file as the dataset for this project.

## Resources
- [REST API Design: Pagination](https://example.com)
- [HATEOAS](https://example.com)

## Implementation Steps
1. **Basic Pagination**: Implement pagination using simple page and page_size parameters.
2. **Hypermedia Pagination**: Implement pagination with hypermedia metadata.
3. **Deletion-Resilient Pagination**: Implement pagination that remains robust even when items are deleted from the dataset.

## Project Timeline
- **Project Start**: June 20, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Project End**: June 25, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release**: June 21, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review**: Launched at the project deadline

## Notes
Ensure all functions, modules, and coroutines are well-documented and type-annotated. Adhere strictly to the coding style and format requirements as outlined.
