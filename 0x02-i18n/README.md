# 0x02. i18n Project

## Project Overview
This project involves internationalization (i18n) for a Flask-based web application. The aim is to enable the application to support multiple languages and localize timestamps. You will learn how to parametrize Flask templates, infer the correct locale, and apply localization to timestamps.

## Learning Objectives
- **Parametrize Flask Templates:** Learn to display different languages based on parameters.
- **Infer Locale:** Determine the correct locale using URL parameters, user settings, or request headers.
- **Localize Timestamps:** Convert and display timestamps in the user's local time zone.

## Resources
- **Flask-Babel:** [Flask-Babel Documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Babel/)
- **Flask i18n Tutorial:** [Flask i18n Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pvtnrFR5hM)
- **pytz:** [pytz Documentation](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/)

## Requirements
- **Platform:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- **Style Guide:** Follow pycodestyle (version 2.5)
- **File Endings:** All files must end with a new line
- **Shebang:** The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- **Executables:** All `*.py` files should be executable
- **Documentation:** 
  - Modules, classes, and functions must have documentation strings (docstrings) that explain their purpose.
  - Ensure the docstrings are full sentences and meaningful.
- **Type Annotations:** All functions and coroutines must include type annotations.

## Project Timeline
- **Start:** Jul 2, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End:** Jul 3, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Jul 2, 2024, 12:00 PM
- **Manual QA:** Request manual QA review once you are done with the project.
- **Auto Review:** An automatic review will be launched at the deadline.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Ensure you are using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and have Python 3.7 installed.
   - Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Running the Application:**
   - Make sure all `.py` files are executable by running `chmod +x *.py`.
   - Start the Flask application using `./run.py`.

3. **Testing:**
   - Ensure your code adheres to `pycodestyle` by running `pycodestyle *.py`.
   - Verify all modules, classes, and functions have proper documentation.
   - Run tests to ensure all functionalities, especially i18n features, are working correctly.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.
   - Use type annotations to ensure code clarity and correctness.

5. **Manual QA Review:**
   - Request a manual QA review after completing the project to get feedback and ensure quality.
